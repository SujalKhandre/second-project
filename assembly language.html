<b>Assembly language is a<mark> low-level programming language </mark><br>
with a direct and strong correspondence to a computer's machine code <br>
instructions. It uses mnemonic codes to represent these machine instructions,<br>
<mark> making them more human-readable compared to raw binary machine code.<br></mark></b>

<u><b><h2>Key characteristics of assembly language include:</h2></b></u>

<ul type="square">
<li><u><b>Low-level:</b></u> It operates very close to the hardware, providing granular control<br>
 over the CPU's registers, memory, and other components.<br>
</li>

<li><b><u>Mnemonic codes:</u></b> Instead of binary sequences, assembly language uses symbolic<br>
 representations (mnemonics) like MOV for move, ADD for addition, and JMP for<br>
 jump, making it easier for programmers to write and understand.<br>
</li>

<li><b><u>Architecture-specific:</u></b> Each assembly language is designed for a particular<br>
 processor architecture (e.g., x86, ARM), meaning code written for one architecture<br>
 typically cannot be directly executed on another without modification.<br>
</li>

<li><b><u>Assembler:</u></b> Programs written in assembly language are translated into machine code<br> 
by a program called an assembler.<br>
</li>

<li><b><u>Direct hardware manipulation:</u></b> It is used in scenarios requiring direct interaction<br>
 with hardware, such as device drivers, embedded systems, and operating system <br>
kernels.<br>
</li>

<li><b><u>Performance optimization:</b></u> Due to its low-level nature, assembly language can<br>
 be used for highly optimized code in performance-critical applications, although <br>
this is less common with modern compilers and higher-level languages.<br>
</li>
</ul>
