<b>C is a general-purpose, procedural programming language developed by<mark> Dennis Ritchie at<br> Bell Laboratories in the early 1970s.</mark> It was initially designed for system programming, particularly<br> for writing the UNIX operating system, but its influence and applications have expanded significantly. <br></b>
</pre>
<u><b><h3>Key characteristics of C:</h3></b></u>
<br>
<ul type="square">
<li><b><u>Mid-level language:</b></u> C combines elements of both high-level<br> and low-level languages. It offers high-level constructs <br>like functions and data types while also<br> providing low-level access to memory through pointers,<br> allowing for efficient hardware interaction.
<br>
</li>
<li><b><u>Procedural:</b></u> C emphasizes breaking down programs into<br> functions, promoting modularity and code reusability.
<br>
</li>

<li><b><u>Efficiency and performance:</b></u> C compiles into highly optimized<br> machine code, leading to fast execution and efficient<br> resource utilization, making it suitable for performance-critical <br>applications and embedded systems.
<br>
</li>

<li><b><u>Portability:</b></u> C programs can be compiled <br>and run on various hardware platforms and<br> operating systems with minimal modifications.
<br>
</li>

<li><b><u>Foundation for other languages:</b></u> C's syntax and concepts<br> have heavily influenced many modern programming <br>languages like C++, Java, and Python, making it a<br> valuable language for understanding fundamental programming principles.
<br>
</li>

<li><b><u>Wide range of applications:</b></u> C is used in diverse <br>fields, including operating systems (like Linux kernels), <br>embedded systems, device drivers, compilers, databases, game<br> engines, and scientific computing.
</li>
</ul>
