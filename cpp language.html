<b>C++ is a powerful, general-purpose programming language<br> developed by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C language.<mark><br> It is a multi-paradigm language, supporting procedural, object-oriented,<br> and generic programming.</mark>
<br></b>

<u><b><h3>Key characteristics of C:</h3></b></u>
<br>
<ul type="square">
<li><u><b>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</u></b>: C++ supports core<br> OOP concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism,<br> and encapsulation, which promote modularity, reusability, and <br>maintainability in software development.
<br>
</li>

<li><u><b>Performance:</b></u> Known for its efficiency and speed, <br>C++ offers low-level memory manipulation and direct hardware <br>access, making it suitable for performance-critical applications.
<br>
</li>

<li><u><b>Cross-platform:</u></b> C++ applications can be developed and run on various<br> operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.
<br>
</li>

<li><u><b>Versatility:</u></b> C++ is used in a wide range of applications,<br> including operating systems, game development, embedded <br>systems, high-performance computing, and graphical user<br> interfaces.
